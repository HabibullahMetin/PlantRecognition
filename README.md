# Image Classification using Python and Deep Learning
This repo contains the code to perform a simple image classification task using Python and Deep Learning. We will apply global feature    descriptors such as Color Histograms.
  
## Summary of the project
We will try to determinate home plants.
Approximately 50 home plants.
Moreover we are gonna give information to user about plants such as water needs.

## Technologies we used
Project has two stages; First one is model of the flower recognition.We used Python and Tensorflow there. Second one is App's texture and the rest.We used TensorflowHub and Android Studio there.
